# FACE_DETECTION_AND_RECOGNITION_CODSOFT
Face Detection - Image/Video Upload
This is a simple face detection application using OpenCV and Tkinter. The app allows users to upload images or videos, and it will detect faces in the uploaded media, displaying them with bounding boxes.

Features
Upload and detect faces in images.
Upload and detect faces in videos.
Display real-time face detection for video uploads.
Interactive GUI using Tkinter.




Requirements
Before running the application, make sure you have the following Python packages installed:
OpenCV (opencv-python)
Pillow (Pillow)
Tkinter (usually comes pre-installed with Python)


How It Works
Face Detection: The app uses OpenCV's pre-trained Haar Cascade Classifier to detect faces in images and video frames.
Real-time Processing: Video face detection is handled using threading to avoid freezing the GUI during video processing.
